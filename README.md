# VLSI-CMOS-Inverter-DesignFlow
A complete VLSI design flow for a CMOS inverter using Cadence Virtuoso. Covers schematic design, symbol creation, testbench setup, transient and DC analysis, layout generation, DRC and LVS checks. AV extraction is pending. Ideal for students and professionals in VLSI design.
The project demonstrates a full design flow for a CMOS inverter, a fundamental building block in VLSI design. Using Cadence Virtuoso, the following steps are covered:
1. Schematic Design: A well-structured CMOS inverter schematic.
2. Symbol Creation: A reusable symbol for hierarchical design.
3. Testbench Setup: Configuring testbenches for transient and DC simulations.
4. Transient and DC Analysis: Detailed simulation results, ensuring the design meets performance criteria.
5. Layout Generation: Converting the schematic to a physical layout while adhering to design rules.
6. DRC and LVS Checks: Ensuring that the layout is error-free and matches the schematic design.
7. AV Extraction (Pending): The final step, parasitic extraction, will be added shortly.
